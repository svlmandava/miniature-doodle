I have been learning basic GIT workflows and got to know LINUX.
Skills that are absolutely necessary for developer to have are GIT and Linux.
Linux is an amazing operating system and GIT is the best version control out there.
Got an idea about what CSS and JavaScript are, and the basics of using them.
I found JavaScript to be more harder than CSS. As JS is a full programming language.
It could have been better if I spend more time on exploring GIT.
