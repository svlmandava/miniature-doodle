GANITA Vs. FORMAL MATH:
        Ganita has a practical value and is more universal than Western maths. To put it simply, ganita provides reason with facts whereas formal math provides only the reason.
        Ganita is reffered to Indian mathematics. Many indian mathematicians(Aryabhatta,Bhaskara, etc) contributed to ganita. The main branches of math include: algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, statistics and probability. Western maths which is taught today was historically originated as ganita. 
        Aryabhatiya provides many ideas on mathematics. If we consider calculus, it was originated in the process of aryabhata's attempts to calculate trignometric values. Also, the concept of zero was given by Brahmagupta which seems to be the greatest innovations.  
        In mathematics, we cannot prove anything with ease. To avoid this difficulty formal math is widely used.Formal math is something that has theorems and proofs which needs to be verified. The calculation techniques of ganita are used in the practical applications of commerce, science and engineering.
        Western math provides expressions that can be used in calculations directly without a need to know the meaning behind the expr. This reduces the complexity in calculations.Ganita has no such expressions or formulas to do calculations. This helps us to calculate much harder problems.
