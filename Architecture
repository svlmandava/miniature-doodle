                                       ARCHITECTURE
                                        
        Architecture is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings or other structures. It can also mean knowledge of art, science, technology, and humanity.There are at least as many definitions of architecture as there are architects.
        According to Vitruvius-a Roman author, architect, civil and military engineer,a good building should satisfy the three principles of 
-Durability – a building should stand up robustly and remain in good condition
-Utility – it should be suitable for the purposes for which it is used
-Beauty – it should be aesthetically pleasing
        The difference between the ideals of architecture and mere construction is that you employ stone, wood, and concrete, and with these materials you build houses and palaces: that is construction. Ingenuity is at work. Architecture starts when you carefully put two bricks together.The term architecture applies only to buildings designed with a view to aesthetic appeal.
        Building first evolved out of the dynamics between needs and means. As human cultures developed and knowledge began to be formalized through oral traditions and practices, building became a craft, and "architecture" is the name given to the most highly formalized and respected versions of that craft. Architecture requires hard work, dedication, and a touch of creativity.
        It is widely assumed that architectural success was the product of a process of trial and error, with progressively less trial and more rethe types of architecture depend upon social formations and may be classified according to the role of the patron in the community. plication as the results of the process proved increasingly satisfactory. What is termed vernacular architecture continues to be produced in many parts of the world.
        An architectural style is characterized by the features that make a building or other structure notable and historically identifiable. A style may include such elements as form, method of construction, building materials, and regional character. Most architecture can be classified as a chronology of styles which change over time reflecting changing fashions, beliefs and religions, or the emergence of new ideas, technology, or materials which make new styles possible.
        The types of architecture depend upon social formations and may be classified according to the role of the patron in the community.These include domestic architecture, vernacular architecture, power architecture, religious architecture, governmental architecture, recreational architecture, theatres, auditoriums, funerary art and a lot more.
        "Architecture" is even used as a metaphor for many modern techniques or fields for structuring abstractions. These include:
-Computer architecture, a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems, with software architecture, hardware architecture and network architecture covering more specific aspects.
-Business architecture, defined as "a blueprint of the enterprise that provides a common understanding of the organization and is used to align strategic objectives and tactical demands",Enterprise architecture is another term.
-Cognitive architecture theories about the structure of the human mind.
-System architecture a conceptual model that defines the structure, behavior, and more views of any type of system.
        A distinction was made between “art architects” and practical-minded civil engineers.A fledgling engineering student is seldom asked to design a whole structure whereas architectural students begin by designing whole structures and proceed with structures of increasing size and complexity, either graphically or by means of small-scale models.
        Architects work on scales starting from a small room in a house to an entire city. They design, develop, present, and supervise all sorts of projects. Their knowledge, design skills, and artistic sense make them capable of approaching other paths like graphic design, product design, or even game design.
        The different types of architects include Residential Architect,Commercial Architect, Interior Designer, Green Design Architect, Landscape Architect, Urban Designer, Industrial Architect, Conservation Architect etc.
        A design architect is one who is responsible for the design.A project architect is one who is responsible for ensuring the design is built correctly and who administers building contracts – in non-specialist architectural practices the project architect is also the design architect and the term refers to the differing roles the architect plays at differing stages of the process.
